Adds the ability to search through blogs into your WordPress Multisite installation.

== Description ==

Easily search through all blogs into your WordPress Multisite by post title, post content or post author.
Multisite Global Search doesn't work with single WordPress installation and it must be activated for all sites using "network activate" in the Administration Panel.
Currently in the following languages:

* Dutch (nl_NL) by Niels Boos [Webdiensten ZZP](http://www.webdienstenzzp.nl)
* English
* German (de_DE) by Dennis Vorpahl
* French (fr_FR) by Fabrice Perrinel
* Italian (it_IT) by Davide Tommasin
* Norwegian Bokmal (nb_NO) by Tore Johnny Bråtveit
* Portuguese (pt_PT) by Jose Anjos
* Russian (ru_RU) by Sam Savinov
* Romanian (ro_RO) by Alexander Ovsov [Web Hosting Geek Science](http://webhostinggeeks.com/science/)

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can send [gettext .po and .mo files](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) to me so that I can bundle it into Multisite Global Search.

== Installation ==

**Requirements**

* WordPress Multisite Installation.
* MySQL 5.0.1 or greater.
* The MySQL user needs to be assigned the ability to "create views" and "drop views" in WordPress database.
* Permalink structure must be diferent to default when widget is activated in a blog of your network.

**Installation is easy**

1. Upload `multisite-global-search` folder to the `wp-content/plugins` directory in your WordPress multisite installation.
2. Activate the plugin in your Administration Panel.
3. Create a new page in your main site with the permalink URL: `http//yoursite/globalsearch/.`.
4. Place `[multisite_search_result]` in the post content area.
5. Activate widget `Multisite Global Search`.

**Upgrade instructions**

1. Deactivate the plugin in your Administration Panel.
2. Earlier version to 1.2.2 needs drop tables from the database: drop view yourdatabaseprefix_v_posts; drop view yourdatabaseprefix_v_comments; drop view yourdatabaseprefix_v_postmeta;
3. Upgrade the plugin.
4. Activate the plugin in your Administration Panel.
5. Activate widget `Multisite Global Search`.

== Customization ==

You may make a few customizations to how the plugin looks and behaves.  To make these customizations, you will need to be able to write to the multisite-global-search directory.

**Adding Behavior Customizations**

1. Make a file in the multisite-global-search directory called "config_local.php".
2. See the file called "config.php" for the list of items you may customize.  The file contains documentation for each of them.
3. Copy the lines containing variables you wish to change to config_local.php and alter them as desired.  Take care to retain formatting, for example, the line-ending semicolon.
4. Make a backup copy of your config_local.php that is stored outside your Wordpress installation!

**Adding Look and Feel Customizations**

1. Make a file in the multisite-global-search directory called "customstyle.css".
2. Add your style alterations to this file.  It will be loaded after the default style.css.
3. Make a backup copy of your customstyle.css that is stored outside your Wordpress installation!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you have any further questions, please submit them.

= Can the search form be used with a shortcode in templates versus the widget? =

Insert search form in templates using the shortcode: `[multisite_search_form]`

= How can show horizontal form using the shortcode? =

Use `type` attribute to select vertical form or horizontal form. For example: `[multisite_search_form type="horizontal"]`
Default attribute value is `vertical`.

= How can change results page URI when you insert search form with the shortcode? =

Use `page` attribute to change results page URI. For example: `[multisite_search_form page="multisite-search"]`. Search results will be showed in http://your_blog_URL/multisite-search.
Default attribute value is `globalsearch`. 

= Can I put search form into PHP files using a function? =

Yes. For example, this is a results page for word 'e-learning': http://grial.usal.es/agora/busqueda/?mssearch=e-learning&msp=1&mswhere=all

In this case, the name of the results page is 'busqueda' so the code that it will have to put in the PHP template must be:

`<?php Multisite_Global_Search::ms_global_search_vertical_form('busqueda') ?>`
or
`<?php Multisite_Global_Search::ms_global_search_horizontal_form('busqueda') ?>`

= Get error "check you have create views privilege in your WordPress database. Illegal mix of collations for operation 'UNION'". =

The instruction means that you may not have given the necessary priviledges to your MySQL user. The user needs to be assigned the ability to "create views".

= Limit results to just the title and the excerpt =

Edit results page and place `[multisite_search_result excerpt="yes"]` in the post content area instead of `[multisite_search_result]`

= Set the plugin to always perform searches also in pages =

Check option "Search by default on pages" when you configure Multisite Global Search Widget.

If you use shortcode `[multisite_search_form]` use `search_on_pages` attribute to search by default on pages. For example: `[multisite_search_form search_on_pages="1"]`.
Default attribute value is `0`.

= Customizing search form =

You have to copy the CSS code from the stylesheet in the Multisite Global Search directory, paste it in your own stylesheet and modify it.
